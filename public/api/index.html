    <h1>Welcome to the extremely poorly designed API page</h1>

    At least we have one. You found it...

    <h2>1. Usage</h2>
    Here we follow the guidelines set by <a href="http://semver.org/">this</a> writeup.
    
    <h2>2. Table of Contents</h2>
    Wait, this should be before usage...<br>

    Coming "soon"!
    
    <h2>4. Versions</h2>
    <h3>0 (Beta) </h3>
    <h4>.0.1</h4>
    
    Unfortunately, little documenting was done during the first year of <a href="http://this.spooks.me">Spooks'</a> existence.<br>
    So we can't copy all the known stuff. However Spooks is currently at version 5, it's said.<br><br>
    Version 1 was <a>http://shame.has.abandoned.us</a><br>
    Version 2 was the initial webchat<br>
    Version 3 is the modern spooks<br>
    Version 4 was all changes after<br>
    Version 5, more changes?<br>
    <br>
    Whatever, we'll say that's how it was.
    
    <h4>.0.2</h4>
    
    This is the version we're on. Changes are migrating to kpig.tk and removing unused files. And the addition of this API.
